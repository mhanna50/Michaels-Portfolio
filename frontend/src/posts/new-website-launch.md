The new version of my website is finally live, and it feels like opening the studio door to a bright, organized workspace. I wanted every page to explain what I do in plain language, so visitors can immediately tell if they need web design, automation help, or both. The structure is intentionally lean—hero statements, proof, examples, and next steps—so the experience never feels like a maze of tabs. It loads faster, adapts to weather-based themes automatically, and makes the contact paths obvious even on a phone.

Behind the scenes I rewired the CMS so case studies, blog posts, and service details all pull from consistent content blocks. That means I can add new work or insights in minutes without reformatting each page from scratch. The services section now links directly to deep dives that talk through problems, solutions, and pricing ranges, which saves us time during intro calls. Testimonials, FAQs, and pricing snapshots are all in one place, so clients can skim once and feel confident moving forward.

Shipping a site isn’t just a visual exercise; it has to keep working after launch. This build plugs into simple automations that organize contact form submissions, send reminder emails, and surface helpful resources to new leads automatically. Analytics now track which sections people read before they reach out, so I can keep improving the most-used moments instead of guessing. If you haven’t clicked around yet, take a look—I’d love to know what stands out or what else you’d like to see next.
